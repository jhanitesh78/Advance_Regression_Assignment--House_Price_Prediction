# House-Price-Prediction [Adavced Regression Assignment]
- This assignment contains two parts. 
Part-I is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter Notebook), and 
Part-II includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file). 


# Business Problem :
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:
-Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
-How well those variables describe the price of a house.
-Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

# Final Recommendations for the company after detailed analysis:
Suggestions for Surprise Housing is to keep a check on top five predictors affecting the price of the house found using Lasso Model
